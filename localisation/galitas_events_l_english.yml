gal_kktb_collapse.1.d:0 "The Guarddom is unsubstainable and the failed crussades turned the military state weak. The Holy guard is whoring in the capital whilst the populus and noblety rebell and sack the same towns they sworn to protect. Independence and destruction cover the old lands of Klakateba, and the holy guardian holds no power anymore. There's an emperor in every corner, but who will rule over the sacred Xi, and the lesser Gi?"
gal_kktb_collapse.2.d:0 "You flee into central klakateba entering a land full of core/family disputes and guarddom remnants!"
gal_kktb_collapse.3.d:0 "You go further south into Gí territory, peasants rule and misticism is the force of reason for some leaders. Unorganized tribes still linger throught the woods with no one to stop them. Years of opression and aparthaid have left the people with a spirit of rebellion and discomfort."
